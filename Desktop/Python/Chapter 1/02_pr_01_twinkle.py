print('''Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
When the blazing sun is gone
When he nothinog shines upon
Then you show yur little light
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Good night, baby.''')
